Add a new feature to the KitchenOS application. Follow these steps:

1. First, ask me for details about the feature:
   - What is the feature?
   - What pages/components are affected?
   - Does it need database changes?
   - Any specific requirements or constraints?

2. Create a plan using TodoWrite tool with:
   - Database migration (if needed)
   - Components to create/modify
   - API routes (if needed)
   - Testing the feature locally

3. Implement the feature following Next.js 16 and TypeScript best practices

4. Test the implementation with `npm run dev`

5. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues

6. Ask if I'd like to commit the changes
