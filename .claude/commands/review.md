Review the current codebase and check for:

1. TypeScript errors and type safety
2. Next.js best practices (App Router conventions)
3. Unused imports or variables
4. Code organization and structure
5. Potential performance issues
6. Security concerns (especially Supabase RLS)
7. Accessibility issues in UI components

Provide a summary of findings with:
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Suggestions (nice to have)
- Best practice recommendations

Ask if I'd like to fix any of the identified issues.
