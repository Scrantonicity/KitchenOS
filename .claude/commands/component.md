Create a new React component for KitchenOS:

1. Ask me for component details:
   - Component name
   - Purpose/functionality
   - Props needed
   - Should it be a server or client component?
   - Styling requirements

2. Determine appropriate location:
   - `app/` for page components
   - `lib/components/` for reusable UI components

3. Create component with:
   - TypeScript interface for props
   - Proper component type (server by default)
   - 'use client' directive if needed
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Lucide React icons if needed
   - Proper exports

4. Show the component for review

5. Ask if unit tests or additional variants are needed
